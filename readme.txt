Adds your Google Analytics Tracking ID to your headers.

== Description ==

This is a very simple WordPress plugin that adds the code needed for Google Analytics to your page. You just need to install the plugin, activate it, and enter your Tracking ID.

Technical Details (in case you are curious, the plugin takes care of this for you)

If your Google Analytics Tracking ID is UA-XXXXXXXX-1, this code needs to be added to your page headers for tracking to occur:

<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXX-1"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-1');
</script>

The plugin adds a field to the General Settings page for you to enter your Tracking ID. Activate the plugin, enter your Tracking ID - that's all you have to do. The code above (with your Tracking ID) will automatically be inserted into the header of each page your readers view.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/technicality-google-analytics` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly. 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Settings->General screen to enter your Google Tracking ID.
